# Hi there! 👏👏🏻👏🏼👏🏽👏🏾👏🏿
I am ***Zhaoxun Liu*** 🙋🏻‍♂️, you can always call me ***Springs*** if this procounces more easily.

Currently I'm a junior year student in [Beihang University, also known as BUAA](http://buaa.edu.cn/) pursuing ***B.Eng.*** in [Computer Science](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/).

------

I have been pondering how machines can break out of their computational boundaries to understand human intelligence. My goal is to develop computationally efficient deep learning models and algorithms, building the computational foundations to enable computers with the abilities to analyze, recognize and predict subtle human communicative behaviors during social interactions.



## To know more about me… 🤔

My [personal site](https://sprlau.github.io/) and [resume](https://sprlau.github.io/resume.pdf) are always public. ☑️



## Get in touch! 📨

Wanna to…

* say hello?
* ask for a helping hand?
* report an issue?
* offer an opportunity?
* discuss something?
* ……?

I am always friendly and open 😝, just come and [send](mailto:lau@buaa.edu.cn)!

> I know you won’t but meaningless harassing is never welcomed. 😅
